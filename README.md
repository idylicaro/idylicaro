<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Idyl Icaro</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a Information Systems student 💻 in Brazil 🌎 at Federal University of Sergipe 📚</h3>

<p align="left"> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=idylicaro" alt="idylicaro" /> </p>

- 🎓 **Currently, I'm studying at the Federal University of Sergipe (UFS), the 6th period of the Information Systems course.**

- 👨‍💻 **A bit about me,i really think that learning something is fundamental to continue living my life, so I like studying technology in general, I would like to realize this more early (I think I would have created a lot of fun things). I'm not a genius and I'm not close to that, but I really believe in hard work 📘 (I believe and do it). I ❤️ software engineering as its architectures to code and practices that are interesting, like techniques like TDD or model of solutions to problems to codes like design patterns, I really love it, 🔰 although I still can't understand a lot of things right now (🎌 I need experience so please invite me to help you with any project, I would like)**

- 📚 **I'm currently learning about docker/deploy/scalability and some design patterns. Also, I'm learning about deep learning.**

- ⚡ **I'm currently participating in three projects, the first is a research project involving web development at (fapitec/seduc) and the second is a scholarship for me to help students that have problems with programming classes at the University and third is a  research project involving  Unity3D where I'm a volunteer by the University**
